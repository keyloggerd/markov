The above article is a contemporary musing on the 2004 presidential election and
the effect of electronic voting on public perceptions of elections. The article
opens by discussing the 2000 Presidential election in Florida, in which
punch-card voting was very close and led to recounts and controversy. It goes on
to discuss the Help America Vote Act , which encouraged and provided
funding for states to upgrade to more technology-forward voting systems. One
such system was used in a 2003 Indiana election and produced 144000 votes from
only 5352 voters. These discrepancies suggest we should consider the legitimacy
and security of electronic voting methods.

In the reading "Why Technology Hasn't Delivered More Democracy", Larry Diamond
makes the point that "Autocrats know how to use technology," and I would point
out that so do others. Between foreign powers with deep pockets and more local
hackers with personal motivations, there is no shortage of people who might be
interested in hacking and manipulating any electronic voting system to bend it
to their will. And as Senem Aydin Duzgit points out, "limits on technology
persist" - no amount of laws or legislation will be able to truly control
software or hardware vulnerabilities. Only engineering and proper care can do
that. If technology in the realm of voting-the central tenet of all democracy-is
to be trusted and worthwhile, it will need to be rigorously protected and tested
or it will only be a detriment to democracy.
